baseline,1,Current operations for California water,,It is like using a basic recipe before trying new ingredients. You need to know how the original turns out so you can tell if your changes make it better or worse.,"Baseline scenarios show how California manages water today. They serve as a reference point for current operations - the laws, regulations, priorities, and decisions that affect how California water supply is managed.","These scenarios show how California manages water today, representing current operational practices.",,,,,1,1,1
community_water,1,Prioritizing domestic water for communities,,"California Human Right to Water law made it a goal to provide safe, reliable water for everyone - but that goal has not been fully met.","All Californians need water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and running businesses, schools, and hospitals. These scenarios focus on giving priority to community water needs.",These scenarios prioritize water for communities that rely on surface water but may not receive reliable supplies.,,,,,1,1,1
flow,1,Enhancing river flows for the environment,,"Rivers and streams need enough water flowing through them to stay healthy. When there is not enough flow, ecosystem health declines.","Environmental flows are essential for supporting native fish, wildlife habitats, and overall ecosystem health. These scenarios explore different approaches to ensuring adequate instream flows.",These scenarios focus on maintaining or enhancing environmental flows in key river systems to benefit salmon populations and other aquatic species.,,,,,1,1,1
gw_ag,1,Managing groundwater in a changing agricultural landscape,,"Groundwater is like a savings account for dry years, but if you withdraw more than you deposit, the account eventually runs dry.",Agricultural water use accounts for a significant portion of California water consumption. These scenarios explore how changes in groundwater management affect agricultural operations.,"These scenarios examine different approaches to groundwater management in agricultural areas, including sustainable practices.",,,,,1,1,1
delta_flow,1,Improving flows for the health of Bay Delta estuary,,"The Delta is the heart of California water system, where rivers meet before flowing to the ocean. More flow through the Delta means healthier ecosystems but less water for other uses.",The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is a critical ecosystem and the hub of California water conveyance system. Environmental flows through the Delta are essential for maintaining water quality and supporting endangered species.,These scenarios focus on increasing environmental flows through the Delta to support ecosystem health and salmon populations.,,,,,1,1,1
delta_uses,1,Sustaining uses in the Delta for communities and farms,,"People live, work, and farm in the Delta. Their water needs matter too, even as we work to protect the environment.","The Delta is home to communities, farms, and businesses that depend on reliable water supplies. These scenarios explore how to balance local water needs in the Delta with environmental protection.",These scenarios examine approaches to maintaining reliable water supplies for Delta communities and agricultural operations while meeting environmental objectives.,,,,,1,1,1
delta_export_reliability,1,Improving reliability of Delta exports for farms and cities,,Millions of Californians depend on water that flows through the Delta. Making those deliveries more reliable could help communities and farms plan better.,"Water exported from the Delta supplies millions of Californians and thousands of farms. Export reliability affects water supply planning, agricultural decisions, and urban water management throughout the state.","These scenarios focus on approaches that could increase the reliability of Delta water exports, potentially through infrastructure improvements or operational changes.",,,,,1,1,1
