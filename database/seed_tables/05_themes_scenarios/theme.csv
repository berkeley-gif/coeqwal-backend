1,baseline,1,Current operations for California water,,Current operations,It is like using a basic recipe before trying new ingredients. You need to know how the original turns out so you can tell if your changes make it better or worse.,"Baseline scenarios show how California manages water today. They serve as a reference point for current operations - the laws, regulations, priorities, and decisions that affect how California water supply is managed.","These scenarios show how California manages water today, representing current operational practices.","{
  ""Using Models"": ""The Calsim computer model simulates the conditions, operations and deliveries of California's water supply. This helps government agencies\nmanage our water system and plan for the future.\nCalSim is most useful for comparing the outcomes of different scenarios and exploring the relative benefits, impacts, and tradeoffs. This is because\nCalsim only approximates how our water system works. It reveals how specific decisions and climate conditions may affect different water uses. But it does not predict the future.\nCOEQWAL uses a 2023 CalSim baseline scenario developed by the Department of Water Resources (DWR)."",
  ""How it works"": ""Key actions are combined in different ways to explore how changes in current operations affect water deliveries, communities, and ecosystems. Temporary Urgency Change Petitions (TUCPs) allow regulatory flexibility during droughts. They can be turned 'on' or 'off' when represented in Calsim and the baseline scenario."",
  ""Addressing equity & resilience"": ""CalSim models major water system features but simplifies or omits others, such as Tribal water needs, rural communities, and some groundwater basins.\nThe model does not directly simulate factors critical to ecosystem health like water temperature or fish populations. COEQWAL aims to fill gaps by evaluating outcomes for overlooked communities and ecosystems.""
}","""With the baseline scenario, we can explore and compare alternative future scenarios. The comparisons can reveal whether changes to rules and policies may affect specific outcomes, offering insights into trade-offs.
A multitude of outcomes are generated by CalSim scenarios.""","""The current operations scenarios illustrate how water has been managed in recent years. Each scenario outcome shows how water is:
• stored in reservoirs
• moved through canals
• shared between communities, farms, and the environment
Using current operations as a baseline helps us understand how and why water is allocated to different users. This also allows us to understand
how potential changes to water operations and climate may affect water allocations in the future.""",1,1,
2,community_water,1,Prioritizing community water systems,,Managing groundwater,"California Human Right to Water law made it a goal to provide safe, reliable water for everyone - but that goal has not been fully met.","All Californians need water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and running businesses, schools, and hospitals. These scenarios focus on giving priority to community water needs.",These scenarios prioritize water for communities that rely on surface water but may not receive reliable supplies.,"{
  ""Scenario context"": ""Despite California declaring access to drinking water a human right, many communities face shortages, especially in dry years. This means that not every person or community receives the water they need or want for cooking, cleaning, sanitation or important community amenities or services like plants, schools, businesses and hospitals.\nClimate change makes these challenges more pressing and difficult."",
  ""How It Works"": ""These scenarios prioritize water for communities that rely on surface water, but may not receive reliable supplies from their utility. Interventions explored include prioritizing a minimum amount for basic health and human safety, a higher amount to also support businesses and services, and an even greater amount to satisfy all community water demands.\nThis project does not address water challenges for groundwater-dependent communities."",
  ""Addressing Equity & Resilience"": ""California’s Human Right to Water law was passed to ensure all people receive the minimum water they need to live. By modeling scenarios that prioritize drinking water for communities, COEQWAL evaluates the trade-offs needed to achieve that goal.\nPrioritizing drinking water is likely to improve reliability for some junior water rights holders that serve disadvantaged communities, but may reduce availability for senior rights holders and other sectors. This shift raises important questions about balancing historic rights with modern needs and building a more equitable, resilient water system.""
}","""The scenarios in this theme increase community water deliveries, including to those that rely on Delta exports.
These changes are likely to affect other uses, including agricultural water deliveries and environmental water.""","COEQWAL simulations indicate how much water is delivered to communities relative to their needs.
Prioritizing drinking water allocations lowers the risk of water shortages for communities that rely on surface water, but may affect other water users, including agriculture and ecosystems. As more water is allocated to communities, these impacts are likely to increase. If surface water deliveries to agriculture are reduced, unrestricted groundwater pumping may further stress aquifers in the valley.",1,1,
3,flow,1,Enhancing river flows for the environment,,Enhancing river flows,"Rivers and streams need enough water flowing through them to stay healthy. When there is not enough flow, ecosystem health declines.","Environmental flows are essential for supporting native fish, wildlife habitats, and overall ecosystem health. These scenarios explore different approaches to ensuring adequate instream flows.",These scenarios focus on maintaining or enhancing environmental flows in key river systems to benefit salmon populations and other aquatic species.,"{
  ""Scenario context"": ""The COEQWAL platform explores ways to manage river flows to protect the environment while also meeting the needs of agriculture and communities that rely on water. Overall, the goal of these scenarios is to rebalance flow regimes in support of ecological needs."",
  ""How It Works"": ""This scenario adjusts how and when water is released from dams to\nmaintain functional flows – those that mimic natural seasonal flow\npatterns in ways that sustain essential ecosystem functions.\nThis scenario provides water to meet functional flows in key tributaries\nincluding seasonal, short-term pulses of higher flows to support salmon\nmigration and spawning in the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.\nThe scenario also requires that river flows continue through the Delta."",
  ""Addressing Equity & Resilience"": ""This scenario shifts water priorities to better support ecosystems and\ntribal communities.\n\nEcological resilience is expected to improve, but farming communities\ncould face greater risk from reduced water supply reliability.\nDrinking water impacts to communities will vary. Communities in\nthe Delta may see better water quality at some times of the year,\nwhile communities that rely on exports may be impacted without\nadaptations in urban water management.""
}""","""The scenarios in this theme will modify river flows and Delta outflows, which are expected to benefit salmon populations.
These changes will affect other system outcomes, including reservoir storage volumes, salinity in the Delta, and water deliveries throughout the Central Valley.""","""Functional flows maintain five seasonal components of the flow
regime vital for ecosystem health.""",1,1,
4,gw_ag,1,Managing groundwater in a changing agricultural landscape,,Prioritizing community water systems,"Groundwater is like a savings account for dry years, but if you withdraw more than you deposit, the account eventually runs dry.",Agricultural water use accounts for a significant portion of California water consumption. These scenarios explore how changes in groundwater management affect agricultural operations.,"These scenarios examine different approaches to groundwater management in agricultural areas, including sustainable practices.","{
  ""Scenario context"": ""Today, California farmers and small towns rely heavily on groundwater, but when too much groundwater is pumped, wells dry up, ecosystems are harmed, and the ground can sink (land subsidence). The COEQWAL platform helps communities explore choices — like switching crops or taking a break from farming some fields — to reduce groundwater depletion. Overall, the goal of these scenarios is to bring groundwater pumping to sustainable levels."",
  ""How it works"": ""These scenarios are designed to meet SGMA goals by bringing groundwater pumping in the Central Valley to long-term sustainable levels. They include reductions in irrigated agriculture that are expected to occur in the future after SGMA is implemented."",
  ""Addressing equity & resilience"": ""Reducing pumping to stop and reverse overdraft of groundwater\nbasins is critical to a climate resilient future. However, restrictions on groundwater are likely to have significant impacts on farms and the communities that depend on agriculture. Balancing the goal of long-term sustainability with the goal of\npreserving a vibrant agricultural economy is a major challenge.""

exports.These changes are likely to affect other uses, including agricultural water deliveries and environmental water.""",,1,1,
5,delta_flow,1,Improving flows for the health of the Bay Delta estuary,,Improving Bay-Delta ecosystem health,"The Delta is the heart of California water system, where rivers meet before flowing to the ocean. More flow through the Delta means healthier ecosystems but less water for other uses.",The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is a critical ecosystem and the hub of California water conveyance system. Environmental flows through the Delta are essential for maintaining water quality and supporting endangered species.,These scenarios focus on increasing environmental flows through the Delta to support ecosystem health and salmon populations.,"{
  ""Scenario context"": ""Changes in the volumes, seasonality, and quality of water flowing out of the Delta (in combination with other stressors, such as loss of habitat) have contributed to long-term declines in the health of the Bay Delta ecosystem. Delta salinity is largely determined by outflow volumes (higher outflow generally reduces salinity; lower outflows increase Delta salinity)."",
  ""How It Works"": ""Scenarios would establish new requirements for augmenting Delta outflows as a percentage of their natural, unimpaired seasonal volumes. These requirements would need to be satisfied before other water demands are considered. By modeling these scenarios, COEQWAL builds understanding of how Delta outflows can be balanced with other water management needs."",
  ""Addressing Equity & Resilience"": ""This theme measures equity by tracking outcomes across different water uses. We assess changes in: deliveries to agricultural water users, deliveries to communities, water quality conditions that affect the ability of in-Delta communities and agriculture to access freshwater, and indicators of ecosystem health.\nBy comparing outcomes across groups, COEQWAL highlights who benefits, who bears the burden of changes, and how trade-offs could be managed for a more equitable and resilient water system.""
}","""The scenarios in this theme increase Delta outflows. These changes are likely to affect other uses, including community and agricultural water deliveries, as well as salmon populations and reservoir storage. It will also affect salinity within the Delta, with benefits or impacts for in-Delta agriculture and community water quality, and Delta exports.""","Increasing Delta outflows are expected to improve ecosystem health, especially if coupled with physical habitat restoration, management of invasive species, and reduction in water-borne pollutants. However, increasing outflows when they are needed are likely to limit other uses of water, including for communities and agriculture.
The salinity of the Delta, which affects in-Delta uses, exports, and ecosystem health, would also be affected by changes in outflows.
Reservoir storage is likely to decline in order to meet higher Delta outflow requirements, making it difficult to achieve other environmental objectives, such as protections for endangered salmon species.",1,1,
6,delta_uses,1,Sustaining uses in the Delta for communities and farms,,Sustaining in-Delta uses,"People live, work, and farm in the Delta. Their water needs matter too, even as we work to protect the environment.","The Delta is home to communities, farms, and businesses that depend on reliable water supplies. These scenarios explore how to balance local water needs in the Delta with environmental protection.",These scenarios examine approaches to maintaining reliable water supplies for Delta communities and agricultural operations while meeting environmental objectives.,"{
  ""How It Works"": ""Scenarios would enhance freshwater inflows in the Delta to maintain water quality conditions needed by in-Delta communities and agriculture. Strategies include reducing agricultural deliveries upstream of the Delta, especially in the Sacramento Valley, changing operations of Shasta Reservoir to require that more water be stored, and increasing Delta outflow requirements. COEQWAL will also explore how relaxing salinity standards may negatively affect in-Delta uses. By modeling these scenarios, COEQWAL builds an understanding of how in-Delta uses that depend on freshwater can be balanced with other water management needs."",
  ""Addressing Equity & Resilience"": ""This theme measures equity by tracking outcomes across different water uses, including needs for communities and agriculture within and outside of the Delta. We assess changes in: deliveries to agricultural water users, deliveries to communities, and water quality conditions that affect the ability of in-Delta communities and agriculture to access freshwater.\nBy comparing outcomes across groups, COEQWAL highlights who benefits, who bears the burden of changes, and how trade-offs could be managed for a more equitable and resilient water system.""
}","""Scenarios in this theme modify Delta salinity for in-Delta agriculture and community uses. These changes are likely to affect other uses, including community and agricultural water deliveries outside of the Delta, as well as reservoir storage. It will also have consequences for Delta outflows and Delta exports.""","""Different strategies for reducing Delta salinity will have different effects. Increasing carry-over requirements could increase reservoir storage, but limit water deliveries to agricultural and communities in some years.
Reducing Sacramento Valley agriculture would have economic impacts to local agricultural communities.
Improving Delta water quality by increasing Delta outflows would affect Delta exports.
Relaxing Delta salinity standards could further degrade the quality of water used by communities and agriculture within
the Delta.
Overall, maintaining water quality in the Delta for community and agricultural uses substantially alter the balance of water
storage and allocations across the water system.""",1,1,
7,delta_export_reliability,1,Improving reliability of Delta exports for farms and cities,,Improving Delta export reliability,Millions of Californians depend on water that flows through the Delta. Making those deliveries more reliable could help communities and farms plan better.,"Water exported from the Delta supplies millions of Californians and thousands of farms. Export reliability affects water supply planning, agricultural decisions, and urban water management throughout the state.","These scenarios focus on approaches that could increase the reliability of Delta water exports, potentially through infrastructure improvements or operational changes.","{
  ""Scenario context"": ""Southern California relies heavily on exports from the Delta. However, the ability to maintain exports is threatened by reduced freshwater inflows from upstream water diversions and sea level rise, which increase salinity in the Delta."",
  ""How It Works"": ""Scenarios in this theme explore how reductions in Delta outflow requirements and reductions in agricultural demands in the Sacramento Valley would affect exports, and what the associated systemwide tradeoffs would be. Scenarios also model the proposed Delta Conveyance Project (DCP), which would divert water from north of the Delta and pipe it directly around the Delta through a tunnel system. By modeling these scenarios, COEQWAL builds understanding of how actions to enhance water supply reliability of Delta exports would affect other water management needs."",
  ""Addressing Equity & Resilience"": ""The construction and operation of the Delta Conveyance Project will likely have significant system-wide impacts. South of the Delta users — including farms in the San Joaquin Valley and municipal water suppliers — would gain more reliable water supplies, while Delta communities and ecosystems would face greater vulnerability to climate change and salinity. The DCP could provide critical backup during a severe water crisis but may also shift water allocations and operational priorities even during normal conditions. The full impacts will depend on future decisions about how the system is managed.""
}","""Scenarios in this theme increase Delta exports by building new conveyance infrastructure, decreasing Delta outflow requirements, and/or limiting agricultural water deliveries north of the Delta. These changes are likely to affect other uses, especially in-Delta community and agricultural uses that rely on limiting Delta salinity.""","""Reducing Delta outflow requirements could have a negative impact on ecosystems and deteriorate salinity conditions in the Delta, affecting in-Delta communities and farms.
Reducing agricultural demands in the Sacramento Valley could increase Delta inflows, potentially improving water quality for in-Delta uses.
The DCP would protect south-of-Delta water supplies from rising salinity and the risks of levee failures in the Delta due to earthquakes or floods. It would therefore likely increase water supply reliability south of the Delta.
Because the project could enable greater water exports, less freshwater would be needed to control Delta salinity and water quality is expected to decline impacting in-Delta communities and farms and harming ecosystems and native fish populations.""",1,1,
